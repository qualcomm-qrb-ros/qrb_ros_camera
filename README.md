# QRB ROS CAMERA

## Overview

`qrb_ros_camera` is a ROS package to publish the camera data from camera sensor.

`qrb_ros_camera` holds significant importance as it serves as a critical component for numerous other ROS nodes that 
rely on image data for analysis and processing. By providing images in the NV12 format, it enables seamless integration 
with a wide range of ROS nodes, empowering advanced image-based analysis and functionalities within the ROS ecosystem.

`qrb_ros_camera` features zero-copy transport for reduced latency, facilitating swift image transmission. It also 
supports concurrent output from multiple cameras, enhancing system performance and scalability in real-time ROS 
applications.
